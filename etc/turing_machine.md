# Turing Machine / Turing Completeness

Compose of these things

- a long tape divied into boxes.
- head that reads the tape
- state registers
- action table 

At some point, there would be a halting state.	

Turing completeness is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a 
Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically 
capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers.

For example, an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional 
branching and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory
