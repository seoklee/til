#Today I Learned

I always have questions in my head. It ranges from language-specific questions to general programming concepts.

I attempt to find appropriate answers them, and most of them are answered. 
Sometimes, I forget the answers to those quesetions, and I have to search for an answer again. 

Therefore, I thought it'd be nice to have one place to store all of answers alongside with few other facts that I came across whilst searching.
